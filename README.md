# Assessing the impact of hyper and hypostereopsis on neuroanatomy learning
This repository is a collection of files and resources for running a small (n~60) randomized controlled trial designed to test the following hypothesis: increased stereoscopic depth as produced by higher inter-camera distance in side-by-side stereoscopic videography will improve the learning of brachial plexus neuroanatomy video module(s).

Stereopsis refers to the ability to perceive depth, stemming speciﬁcally from the disparity and integration of visual information from two laterally located eyes. Each eye receives a slightly diﬀerent angle on objects in the ﬁeld-of-view, causing horizontal or binocular disparities, which when integrated together, produce an understanding of environmental depth to supplement other visual factors such as motion parallax, contrast, overlap, and more. In anatomy education, spatial awareness and understanding of the distances and relationships between structures is paramount. 

Most visual media is recorded by a single camera and projected onto a single screen (with no horizontal disparity). However, binocular disparities can be simulated in conventional video by showing two video feeds from laterally displaced cameras into each eye—virtual reality. So-called stereograms can be inexpensively both produced and delivered on smartphone devices, using VR solutions such as Google Cardboard. Hopefully, democratizing the production of high-quality stereograms delivered as accessibly as possible will improve understanding of spatial anatomy. 

## Creating Stereoscopic 3D anatomy learning experiences: an artistic and technical reference

The following document characterizes methods and considerations, both artistic and technical, when creating a stereoscopic-3D anatomy learning experience. However, it is generally also suited to any type of close-subject stereoscopic media. All software used and referenced within is free and/or open-source, with the exception of some proprietary color-correction programs (which are fully optional).


## An .stl model mount for dual-smartphone stereo filming setup
In an effort to not only democratize the distribution of stereoscopic anatomy learning experiences, but also their production, we have developed a 3D-printable, standard-tripod mountable stand that takes two smartphones (not necessarily of the same model) and positions them with adjustable inter-camera distance to film a subject.

Spaces are included for wired phone setups (so that the phones can be controlled from an external computer connection). More details on such a setup are included in the attached technical reference .pdf file.

## A hyperstereoptic brachial plexus neuroanatomy module (link to YouTube upload)

[![Click this text to see the video.](https://github.com/malyalar/stereoAnatomyReference/blob/master/titleScreenCapture.PNG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEzrbDrXUUg)

This video, available in anaglyph, 2D, and stereoscopic side-by-side 3D on YouTube (see technical guide on how to achieve inter-convertability through video metadata, section 7.2), is a full-featured brachial plexus learning module, from roots to terminal branches. Specific learning objectives when developing the video included the featuring of spatial relationships between the brachial plexus nerves, and associated non-nervous structures (e.g. subclavian artery, humeral bone, scalene muscles, etc).
